**'Software Developer'**

I am a computer science student interested in technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud computing, and any other technology belonging to industry 4.0. 

I am currently learning from scratch Python to be a better coder. 
I am looking to create coding projects to solve real-life problems, but to get there I have to take one step at a time by doing skill-based projects.
